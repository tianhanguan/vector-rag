    "This example shows how to use the Python [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) library to run a natural language RAG search against structured data in a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leverages the [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) API and langchain's [SQL Database Chains](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/sql_database) to translate a natural language prompt into a SQL query. After getting a result, it uses Cohere again to generate a natural language response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- You will need an access key to Cohere's API key, which you can sign up for at (https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/login). A free trial account will suffice, but will be limited to a small number of requests.\n",
    "- After obtaining this key, store it in plain text in your home in directory in the `~/.cohere.key` file.\n",
    "- Next, upload at least 1 pdf file into the `source-materials` subfolder under this notebook. The text in these pdf files will be used to augment your text generation request."
